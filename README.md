# Google-Playstore-Apps-Rating-Prediction

The project involves analyzing Google Playstore app data to predict app ratings using machine learning. It includes data cleaning to handle missing values and convert columns, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends in app ratings, categories, and reviews, and the training of a RandomForestRegressor model to predict ratings. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
